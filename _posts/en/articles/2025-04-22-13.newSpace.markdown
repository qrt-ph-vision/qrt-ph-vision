There was a time when space exploration was the exclusive domain of nation-states.
During the Cold War, intense competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union made space development a government-driven endeavor-characterized by large budgets, long development timelines, and rigid certification processes.
In the 21st century, however, the landscape has shifted dramatically.
<br>
The driving force behind this transformation is known as **“New Space.”**

Unlike the traditional Old Space model led by national space agencies, New Space reflects a shift toward private-sector innovation and market-driven growth.
Hallmarks include lower cost, shorter development cycles, adoption of commercial technology, vertical integration, and service-oriented business models.
This shift is transforming space from a government-only scientific and defense domain into a competitive commercial industry.
<br>
Commercial entities such as SpaceX, Planet Labs, Blue Origin, OneWeb, and Rocket Lab now handle end-to-end space operations-from satellite manufacturing and launch to ground-segment operations and service delivery.
They are democratizing access to space through reusable launch vehicles and large-scale deployment of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), achievements once thought unimaginable.
<br>
Traditionally, space systems relied on expensive space-grade components, but New Space companies increasingly design systems using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies.
This pragmatic approach rests on the premise that commercial-grade hardware can operate reliably in space when its radiation tolerance is validated and appropriate protections (e.g., shielding, redundancy) are applied.
<br>
For example, SpaceX has reduced launch costs to a fraction of historical levels through Falcon 9 reusability.
Meanwhile, small-launch providers like Rocket Lab are pioneering dedicated services for small satellites, opening new opportunities for startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to enter the space industry.

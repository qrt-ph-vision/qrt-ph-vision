# What is COTS?

With the increasing involvement of the private sector in the space industry, Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products are gaining traction as viable options for space system development.  
Unlike space components-typically more costly and slower to procure-COTS components are mass-produced for commercial markets, offering advantages such as reduced costs, shorter development cycles, and faster integration of cutting-edge technologies. 
These characteristics make COTS especially attractive to startups and small research institutions. 
<br>
In terms of cost, COTS components benefit from economies of scale, significantly lowering overall system expenses. 
As for development time, leveraging pre-validated commercial products greatly reduces the duration required for design, manufacturing, and testing. 
Another notable advantage is the ability to rapidly incorporate high-performance technologies that evolve quickly in the commercial sector into space systems. 
However, despite these benefits, the use of COTS components presents key challenges in terms of reliability, quality assurance, and environmental robustness.  
<br>
COTS components are typically designed for terrestrial applications, and may degrade or fail under space conditions-high radiation, vacuum, and temperature extremes/thermal cycling. 
Their lack of space-specific screening/qualification and limited long-term durability can pose serious risks to mission success. 
<br/>
To mitigate these risks, thorough testing and screening processes are essential. In addition, incorporate system-level strategies such as redundancy, fault-tolerant architectures, radiation shielding, and thermal control. 
Ensuring reliability requires a holistic approach that extends beyond the component level to include system-level safeguards and verification/validation.
<br/>
In conclusion, while COTS components offer a promising path to faster, more cost-effective space development, their application must be supported by rigorous verification procedures and robust design strategies. 
A balanced approach that carefully weighs their advantages against potential risks is critical for the success of space missions.

# [TCAD](https://www.synopsys.com/manufacturing/tcad.html) - Synopsys

Synopsys TCAD is a widely used commercial software suite for simulating semiconductor device behavior and fabrication processes. It provides physics-based models to analyze radiation effects, including electron-hole pair generation, charge transport, and trap formation induced by energetic particles. The tool is especially effective for evaluating SEU/SET as a function of LET, as well as for modeling TID.
<br>
Using transient simulation, TCAD can model time-dependent current density, voltage transients, and parameter shifts in transistors, enabling quantitative predictions ahead of experimental SEE testing.

# [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/) - CERN, INFN

FLUKA is a general-purpose Monte Carlo code for precise modeling of particle transport and interactions with matter. Free for noncommercial use, it is employed in high-energy physics, medical physics, and space radiation research.
<br>
FLUKA excels in radiation-shielding analysis, dose estimation, energy-deposition tracking, and particle-shower modeling. It also supports DICOM-based 3D voxel geometries, making it suitable for complex space-radiation scenarios.

# [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) - CERN

Geant4 is an open-source C++ simulation toolkit developed at CERN for modeling particle interactions with matter. It offers highly configurable physics lists across a wide energy range.
<br>
Geant4 is widely used in medical imaging, radiotherapy, space-radiation analysis, and detector design. Users can customize experimental conditions and track secondary-particle paths, energy deposition, and charge generation. It is commonly used to model SEE in detectors and semiconductor devices.

# [CHALICE](https://nanohub.org/resources/chalice) - US Naval Research Laboratory

CHALICE is a pulsed-laser simulator developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to compute 2D/3D charge-density distributions for laser-based SEE experiments.
<br>
Given laser parameters (wavelength, pulse width, absorption coefficients), CHALICE simulates charge deposition in sensitive volumes, carrier transport, and penetration depth. It also computes LET<sub>L</sub> (laser-equivalent LET), making it a useful tool for optical SEE modeling.

# [OMERE](https://www.trad.fr/en/space/omere-software/) - TRAD

OMERE is a freeware tool developed by TRAD (France) to estimate radiation environments and effects on semiconductor components in space. It supports SEE, TID, DD, and solar-cell degradation analysis based on modeled particle fluxes.
<br>
The platform includes environment models such as AE8/AP8 and CREME96, as well as ISO 15390, and lets users define mission parameters-orbit (LEO, MEO, GEO, lunar), solar cycle, magnetospheric region, and shielding-to simulate realistic space conditions. OMERE is widely used for radiation-reliability assessment and component screening.

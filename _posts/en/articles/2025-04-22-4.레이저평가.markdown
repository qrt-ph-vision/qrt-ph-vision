# Semiconductor Radiation Hardness Laser Evaluation (Laser Test)

The Pulsed Laser SEE Test (PLSEE) is a method for evaluating the radiation hardness of semiconductors using femtosecond pulsed lasers. It simulates the effects of space radiation on semiconductor devices, providing an effective alternative to traditional radiation testing methods.

Lasers can deliver extremely high energy to a highly localized area within an extremely short duration, inducing electromagnetic responses comparable to those caused by actual particle collisions. SEE evaluations are typically conducted at [heavy-ion beam](/en/article/10.중이온.html) accelerator facilities. However, such facilities have several limitations, including high operational costs, restricted accessibility, and limited suitability for precise localization of sensitive volumes.

The primary advantage of laser testing is the reduction in experimental cost and turnaround time. Traditional radiation tests using particle accelerators are expensive and often difficult to schedule due to limited availability. In contrast, laser-based setups are more accessible and lower-cost to operate, can be installed and operated in laboratory environments, and support rapid iterative testing.
Additionally, lasers offer extremely high spatial accuracy, enabling precise targeting of specific regions within semiconductor devices and facilitating in-depth analysis of vulnerable areas.  This allows potential weaknesses to be identified and mitigated from the early stages of design.

## QRT's Laser Evaluation Technology

QRT is the only provider in Korea with extensive experience in laser-based radiation hardness evaluation. Using a femtosecond pulsed laser system, QRT offers versatile evaluation capabilities supporting both Single Photon Absorption (SPA) and Two Photon Absorption (TPA) methods. We provide services for alternative radiation hardness testing of semiconductors and design validation of radiation-tolerant semiconductor devices.


### SEL Screening & Error Rate

SEE (Single Event Effect) testing is a key method for quantitatively evaluating a device’s sensitivity to error occurrence and its radiation hardness performance. By observing laser-induced Single Event Upset (SEU) phenomena or performing SEL (Single Event Latch-up) screening, cross-section values are derived. These cross sections are then used to determine the LETL (Linear Energy Transfer threshold), which enables prediction and estimation of error rates in actual space or radiation environments.

### Sensitive Area Analysis

QRT's evaluation system features a high-precision XYZ stage controllable at the nanometer level, enabling precise laser targeting at specific coordinates on a semiconductor chip.  
This allows for detailed mapping of Single Event Effects (SEE), effectively identifying **Sensitive Areas** within the circuit layout.


## QRT Laser Lab Access Service
QRT offers lab. access (facility rental) to its laser evaluation systems.
With user-friendly software, you can conduct tests more easily and efficiently.
Detailed manuals for the laser system are available in the [QRT-LITE Manual](/manuals/#lite_kor).
